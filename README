selector
--------
this is a fork of dmenu but with the ability to type
removed (and the prompt removed). 


installation
------------
first edit config.mk to your liking, afterwards:
  make clean

then edit config.h to your liking and:
  sudo make install


running selector
----------------
use it the same way you use dmenu:
  printf 'one\ntwo' | selector -l 2 -i


todo
----
currently, the prompt does not work and pages (the amount
of items that can fit into the current width or length)
needs to be recalculated.
